activating the bridge trap after meeting him

answer No
Oh, really? Yes, I see…Righty-oh!
Then everything's good, isn't it?
I'm Trusty Patches, the one and only!
You and I, just a couple of undead outcasts, right mate? / You and I, just a couple of undead outcasts, right, my darling?

Are you certain?!
Well that's a fine shame. Oh, I'm truly sorry, really!
But, wait now, you didn't actually fall down, then?
Well, why didn't you tell me sooner! All's well that ends well!
Everybody makes mistakes. I'm not above it all, I swear!
I'm trusty Patches, the one-and-only!
I know! This should make up for it. (gives Humanity x1)
We're on the same side! Undead outcasts!
Fantastic isn't it?

ALVINA OF THE DARKROOT WOOD,http://darksouls.wikidot.com/alvina,"Video: Alvina's Dialogues
Video:
First time talking to her
Is it not so that thou art new.
Thou fared well to find me.
But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias?
My advice true, forget this!
The legend of Artorias art none but a fabrication.
… Traversing the dark? 'Tis but a fairy tale.
Have thine own respect, go not yonder knocking for nothing, I say!
Answer ""yes""
Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some liking for thee.
I'm Alvina of the Darkroot Wood.
I command a clan of hunters who track down defilers of the forest graves.
What dost thou say? Wilt thou not join us?
Oh yes, I believe we would suit thee well.
Answer ""yes""
I am very glad!
And now thou art one of us! Let us establish a Covenant.
And here, thaketh this ring.
If thou weareth that ring, it allows for thine summoning.
If mine senses reveal intruders, then I will summon thee.
Fend them off sir, I beseech only this.
I shall summon others, who will by their honour work tirelessly with thee.
Thou shalt receive great reward, and whatsoever ye shall pillage will be thine own.
A true agreement, not so?
But thou must heed the golden rule…
The clan is thine own family. To thine kinsmen forever stay true.
Dare'st not in any attempt to double-cross. Have no doubt, such wretchedness, never will we tolerate.
Answer ""no""
Oh, I see. 'Tis a pity indeed. But this is thine stubborn choice alone. I cannot enforce it upon you thee. If thine mind should be alter'd, forsooth speak to me once more.
Answer ""no
Hmm, I see. A result most heathenish and gross. Then there is nothing more to say about this tedious reckoning. Be gone from here.

After speaking to Shiva of the East
Perchance…
Hast thou met Shiva?
A lad cometh from the far East, strong of arm; now a clan leader of ours.
… And yet…
Still I feel that boy hides something. Of that I am certain.
Small fear that he will use us badly… Yet on guard we must stay.
And that man that clingeth to Shiva like some shadow… ensure thou dost treat him with the same caution.

Oh, it is thee…

For thee, no mercy shall be shown.

Most weapons and armour are mighty sturdy indeed.
But every hunk of metal has its breaking point.
If you notice durability running low, it's time to repair.
You can ask a blacksmith like myself, or do it on you own with a grindstone.
The nice thing about weapons… they never betray you.
So, pay them a little respect, eh?
There are two types of weapon forging. There's reinforcement, and there's ascension.
Reinforcement is simple. It strengthens the weapon and nothing more.
A simple task for any blacksmith. Hell, you could even do it yourself with a smithbox.
But ascension's a finer art. It alters a weapon's properties.
Ascension is the territory of we blacksmith; a smithbox just won't do the trick.
Start out with reinforcement. When that loses its charm, you can consider ascension.
As you've noticed, this land is flush with the mad and wicked.
You won't make it through the night without employing my services!
Hah hah hah!
You can forge armour just like you do weapons.
Forging armour is even easier than forging weapons.
Whether you forge weapons or armour first? Well, that's up to you.
but nobody wants to see you go Hollow.
So, whatever you do, you'd better do it well!
Hah hah hah!
This is the old church.
It was abandoned in favour of the church that you passed through.
There are paths leading from here to two forbidden planes: Sen's Fortress, and the Darkroot Garden.
They attract all sorts of lunatics, no-one as cultured as yourself.
It's fine to be Undead, but keep a level head, eh?
Hah hah hah!
Sen's Fortress is an old proving grounds built by the ancients gods.
It is the only route leading to the great Anor Londo.
Of course, most fools can't even find their way into that fortified deathtrap.
But they won't stop trying! Take that bumbling Sir Onion…
Hah hah hah!
I know little of the Darkroot Garden.
Although I've heard rumours of a divine blacksmith who resides there.
Those who get stumped in the Catacombs seek him for divine weapons.
Oh, yes, and one other thing about the Darkroot Garden.
It is said to house the grave of Sir Artorias the Abysswalker.
Only, of those who ventured into the forest, none has returned.

If the player has the Divine Ember
My, that's a rare ember you have there.
I've seen one of those before… It's the ember of a divine blacksmith.

Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times.
I am Logan. I'm a bit cooped up, as you can see.
I have a bright idea. Suppose you set me free?
I'm old and empty-handed, but I could repay you with my knowledge, and sorcery.
This place is melting my mind. The inactivity is repressive!

Using the Talk option
Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality?
If you have fought him, and were imprisoned, you must know that Seath is a true Undead, different from ourselves.
His wounds close promptly, and no mortal blow affects him, granting true insulation from death.
It is an effect of the Primordial Crystal, a sacred treasure pillaged by Seath when he turned upon the ancient dragons.
So, only by destroying the Primordial Crystal can you so much as scratch his hide.
And it so happens, the Primordial Crystal is in the inner garden of these very archives, the Crystal Forest.

All progress demands sacrifice.
And I certainly bear no antipathy for that wonderful scaleless beast.

But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum… But, too late now.
Well, since you're here… Let me help you out.
There are actually two Bells of Awakening.
One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far below, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown.
Ring them both, and something happens… Brilliant, right?

Collect it bit by bit from corpses, or you can butter up a cleric, and get yourself summoned.
And the quickest way, although I'd never do it, is to kill a healthy Undead, and pillage its humanity.
Coveting thy neighbour is only human, after all!

Oh woe is the Undead who's cursed on top of it all Harsh times; harsh times indeed!
Hah hah hah hah!
No, no, I'm sorry. Here, let me share a nice tip.
Long ago, I was told of a remedician who resides in New Londo.
Does he really exist? Well, go and find out for yourself.
But don't blame me if he's just an apparition!

If you haven't gone to the Undead Burg or Blighttown
Hm? What, you want to hear more?
Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul.
Well, listen carefully, then…
One of the bells is up above in the Undead Church, but the lift is broken.
You'll have to climb the stairs up the ruins, and access the Undead Burg through the waterway.
The other bell is back down below the Undead Burg,
within the plague-infested Blighttown.
But I'd die again before I step foot in that cesspool!

Stranger things have happened, right?

Oh, have you seen that terribly morose lass?
… The Fire Keeper.
She's stuck keeping that bonfire lit.
Sad, really. She's mute and bound to this forsaken place.
They probably cut her tongue out back in her village, so that she'd never say any god's name in vain.
How do these martyrs keep chugging along? I'd peter out in an instant.

Hmm… You are astonishing.
The truth I shall share without sentiment.
After the advent of fire, the ancient lords found the three souls.
But your progenitor found a fourth, unique soul.
The Dark Soul.
Your ancestor claimed the Dark Soul and waited for Fire to subside.
And soon, the flames did fade, and only Dark remained.
Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark.
However…
Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark.
Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans,
and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them,
Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature.
By sacrificing himself to link the fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans,
Gwyn has blurred your past, to prevent the birth of the Dark Lord.
I am the primordial serpent.
I seek to right the wrongs of the past to discover our true Lord.
But the other serpent, Frampt, lost his sense, and befriended Lord Gwyn.
Undead warrior, we stand at the crossroad.
Only I know the truth about your fate.
You must destroy the fading Lord Gwyn, who has coddled Fire and resisted nature,
and become the Fourth Lord, so that you may usher in the Age of Dark!

I shall now guide you to Gwyn's Prison
Be still. Entrust thine flesh to me.

Enough of this… and farewell to you.

Aye, siwmae. And good day to you.
I'm Domhnall of Zena. I'm just, well, a peddler, of sorts.

Aye, siwmae. Never thought I'd see you here.
This feels karmaic.
Pray tell, what do you have for me?
Aye, siwmae. I didn't expect to meet anybody here. I suppose great minds think alike, eh?
Aye, siwmae. We meet again.
Found anything special for my good self?
Mmm, I certainly hope so!

If you seek Kindling in the Catacombs, use divine weapons.
That will repel the reassembling skeletons.

So, I am willing to share some tips.
The cursed Ghosts of New Londo are formidable foes.
To face them, you will require special arms… Or a cursed body.
The quickest way to be cursed? Try the bug-eyed lizards in the sewer.
Desperate measures, to be sure…

Hmm… You are a fine trading partner.
Rumour it may be, but I have heard of a surviving ancient dragon who resides in this land.
A coterie of Undead serves the dragon, as they train to become dragons themselves.
Sounds unlikely, but you never know, do you?

Speak to her after you kill the Golden Crystal Golem
So, it is thou who rescueth me?
Most graciuous. I am deeply obliged.
I am Dusk of Oolacile.
I cometh from an age long before thine… I can not stay here for long.
So, before i disappear, allow me to ask one thing.
My home, Oolacile, is the home of ancient sorceries.
My hope is to pass this profound knowledge to thee, with thine approval.
Would this be of assistance to thee?
Answer ""yes""
My heartfelt thanks. I am pleased beyond words.
Then, I shalt engrave my signature.
If you art in need, pray summon me from my signature.
It seems that my time is done. May the great flame guide thee.
Answer ""no""
Yes, of course… I understand well. Pray forgive me. I have overstepped my boundaries.
Farewell; another age, another land, beckons me to return. May the flames guide thee.

For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem.
From my home I was taken, and banish'd to a plane of distortion.
It was there, that thou came to my rescue.
Long after I had relinquished all hope.
So gleeful was I, my faith reneweth.
The sorceries of Oolacile differ from the magic of thine age.
It is difficult to explain…
Oolacile sorceries are, what doth one say? They are somewhat… of an approximation.
Thine sorceries are more straight forward, negating all but thy self.
Dost thou not find some fascination in these discrepancies?
My home of Oolacile was reduced to ashes, long ago, in my time.
I have been alone ever since…
But to be summon's thus, and to be of service to thee… It is… most rewarding…
Oh, forgive me, such a long past time is none of thine concern…

Using ""Talk"" option after defeating Manus
This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but…
Long ago, in my homeland of Oolacile, I was beset by a creature of the Abyss.
I would have perished then, were it not for the great knight Artorias.
In truth, I saw little of what transpired, for mine senses were already fled!
But even still, there was something about Artorias… A certain balance of the humours…
…That quite perfectly fits your semblance.
Heavens, could it be that…
…
Oh, dear me. That was Oolacile, many centuries ago.
Please excuse my fanciful musings.
Excuse me for such whimsical utterances.
Only, it was so very odd…
You, and Artorias. I owe my life to each of you. And both seem to share some resonance of sorts…
Perhaps it is the nature of true greatness.
I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed upon me.
My faculties were far from lucid, but I quite clearly sensed certain emotions.
A wrenching nostalgia, a lost joy, an object of obsession, and a sincere hope to reclaim it…
Could these thoughts belong to the beast from the Abyss?
But if that were true, then perhaps it is no beast after all?
Oh, please forgive my ramblings.
It's just that, I wish to know the truth.
And no one, not even loving Elizabeth, will tell me.

only no one has eve seen her, so who really knows?
But what if she is another of the Quelaag sisters?

First time speaking
Well, look at this one
From what far-away age hast thou come?
Thy Scent is very human, indeed.
…But, not intolerable…
Ah, Prince Dusk's saviour.
Thine aura is precisely as she described.
I thank thee deeply, for rescuing Her Highness.
But Princess Dusk is here no longer…
…snatched away by that horrifying primeval human.
And so I must ask…
Couldst thou once more play the saviour?
Answer ""Yes""
Thank you.
I am Elizabeth, guardian of this sanctuary.
Something of a godmother to Princess Dusk.
I shall assist thee, to my utmost.
For I am one with the sorceries of Oolacile.
Answer ""No""
Yes, I understand.
We care dearly for Princess Dusk,
and are apt to blur our boundaries.
I am ashamed to have been so imposing.
But should thine heart be changed, speak to me again.
This sanctuary, and the sorceries of Oolacile, are my domain.
My strength could surely assist thee in thy travels.

Thou shalt see further on.
An abyss was begat of the ancient beast,
and threatens to swallow the whole of Oolacile.
Knight Artorias came to stop this,
but such a hero has nary a murmur of Dark.
Without doubt, he will be swallowed by the Abyss,
overcome by its utter blackness.
…Indeed, the Abyss may be unstoppable…
Still I have faith, that Princess Dusk may be rescued yet…
May the flames guide thee.
Thou art from a time far, far ahead.
There are many things I wish to ask.
But I know that I must not.
The perils of our time are overwhelming enough.
Hah hah…Was thine eye, glancing hither?
Though needst not hide thy wonder.

A human like thineself, from a far-away time.
Only, he was dreadfully odious…
And I am afraid that he is still amongst us.
He wore a hat and a long black coat…

Magnificent… Thou hast filled the Lordvessel.
Indeed, a worthy successor, thou shalt be.

(First encounter)
Hm? A visitor, have we?
Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.
An old friend he was, and thanks to thee…
He left this world with honour intact.
…And here I am, retired and blind.
Of little help to thee, I am afraid.

(First encounter, after killing Kalameet)
Hm? A visitor, have we?
Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.
An old friend he was, and thanks to thee…
He left this world with honour intact.
And I see that the great black dragon Kalameet is dusted by thine hand.
Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.
I am retired, and blind.
To receive a visit by one as lofty as thyself, is a great honour indeed.

Greeting
Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise.
Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one.
(Before killing Kalameet, and accepted his request)
Ah, hello there. What of Kalameet?
He is an ancient dragon. Skyward or no, he will not be put down easily.
(After killing Kalameet)
Thou com'st again, legend of humans.
It is always an honour to speak with thee.

Talk
If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon.
I fear thee no match for this terrible beast.
Me?
There is very little to be said.
What good is a dog, with no hares to hunt?
…I am lucky to be alive, I suppose.
(Second encounter)
I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it,
But the Dark of the Abyss, which swallowed poor Artorias, threatens to devour our entire land of Oolacile.
It seems that this dire fate is unavoidable.
But, seduced by a Dark serpent or no,
They awoke that thing themselves, and drove it mad.
…One's demise is always one's own making.
If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias, and challenge the spread of the Dark,
Then thou must face Manus, Father of the Abyss.
The Dark emanates from Manus himself.
Even if this land shall expire, thou may be able to prevent further corrosion.
…But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.
And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that.
(If answered No after first encountering Kalameet)
The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see.
(Yes/No)
Yes
(dialogue plays out as if Yes was answered the first time)
No
…Hmm, yes, I see… I was mistaken.
(If answered Yes, then No after encountering Kalameet)
…Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?
(Yes/No)
Yes
(dialogue plays out as if Yes was answered the second time)
No
Yes, surely that is best.
(After accepting Gough's request to kill Kalameet)
The dragons shall never be forgotten…
We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them, we lost three score of our own.
Exhiliration, pride, hatred, rage… The dragons teased out our dearest emotions.
…Thou will understand, one day.
At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in great waves of nostalgia.
(After killing Kalameet)
Ahh, this Greatbow?
I shan't need it, with no dragons to hunt.
I know not if a human could even operate it, but here…
Thy need outweighs mine.
Now, do not mistake my words.
I cherish my work. Wood carving is a nuanced art.
I would have much to talk about with that blacksmith.
In truth, how is the old chap, I wonder?
Still hammering away, I should hope.

Good morrow…Is the Black Dragon posing thee duress?
(Yes/No)
Yes
Yes, I thought as much.
He is called Kalameet.
A ferocious dragon indeed, even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire.
I see little good coming from this, but…
…Thy intent is to persevere… to the bitter end, hmm?
(Yes/No)
Yes
Hah hah hah!
Good, good. What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness!
I have taken a liking to thee.
And I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias. Now watch, and see how Gough hunts dragons.
Hrrmmm…

Hah hah! Yes, a truer shot was never loosed!
That bat will be grounded for a good spell!

Ahh, dragon slaying. Knighthood's highest calling…
No

No

Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except for ghosts.
Do you have some business here?
My name is Ingward.
I'm an old man, bound to these parts.
But I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help.

First time speaking to him and you're cursed
Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except ghosts.
Oh, cursed, are you? Is that what brings you to me? It is a wise choice. Your troubles will soon be over.
My name is Ingward.
I'm an old man, bound to these parts. But cleansing your curses; that I can do.
The breaking of curses is the territory of deities. You must be prepared to give some of yourself.

I am the Guardian of the Seal.
I watch over the Four Kings, the masters of the Darkwraiths.
The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any living thing that has a soul.
They were born in New Londo, and that is where they perished; the entire city was sacrificed to contain them.
…For that is how great a threat they were…

Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, save for ghosts.
You have… the Lordvessel.
Very impressive.
I know exactly what your intentions are.
You seek the Four Kings whom I guard over.
This is the key to the seal.
The Four Kings slumber in the deepest chamber of the ruins.
Use this key to break the seal and open the floodgates.
… Oh, and do not forget…
The Darkwraiths reside in a dark void called the Abyss.
But the Abyss is no place for ordinary mortals.
Although long ago, the knight Artorias traversed the Abyss.
If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove surmountable.

Speaking to him
You’ve broken the seal, Have you?
No, I have no regrets, my trust lies with you, and Frampt. (If you have not sided with Frampt: No, I have no regrets. For I trust in you.)
But you cannot proceed without being able to traverse the Abyss..
Long ago, the Four Kings were powerful men. Only, their hearts were weak.
When an evil serpent dangled the art of Lifedrain before them, they were unable to resist, and became pawns of evil.
According to legend, the knight Artorias crossed the Abyss, and annihilated the atrocious Darkwraiths.
If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove surmountable.

Very well. Then I am pleased to share.

Well, perhaps I was wrong.
There can be only one chosen undead. I will continue my search… You are freed from duty.

Answer ""Yes""
A wise choice, indeed.
Maiden Thorolund and her followers recently arrived in this land,
but she became stranded deep below the Catacombs.
Her followers either fled, or were reduced to Hollows… Leaving Maiden Thorolund all alone.

Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless?
In legend, he turned against the ancient dragons.
He became Lord Gwyn's confidant, was granted dukedom, and was allowed to pursue his research.
At the Regal Archives, he immersed himself in research on scales of immortality, the one thing that he did not have.
… But his very research drove him mad…
The Archive became a dungeon, a place for sinister experiments.
Now, nobody dare even approach the duke's forbidden Archives.
It looms over this land, high atop the mountain.

Pyromancy is the art of casting fire.
Produce flame, the channel it; just as our ancestors did.
A pyromancer must be in tune with nature herself.
My home, the Great Swamp, is an abundant store of nature.
You will understand, one day; it only takes time.
Pyromancy has a, well, rather primitive aspect to it.
It meshes poorly with advanced culture,
and pyromancers are considered rather unsavoury.
Which is fine, as I never got along with anybody anyway.
So, for me, turning Undead didn't change a thing!
Hah hah hah hah.

A pyromancer's flame is a part of his own body.

When I gave you that flame, I gave you a part of myself.
Please take good care of it.
My teacher, whom I imagine still resides in the Great Swamp,
had a funny way of putting it.
He said that ""Pyromancy is the ultimate fantasy…""
""We are born into Dark, and warmed by Fire, but this Fire we cannot touch.""
""Those whose fascination with Fire persists, learn to hold it in their own hand.""
He rather had a way with words, the old withering frog!
In this land, pyromancers earn a certain respect.
The Witch of Izalith, one of the legendary Lords,
is the godmother of pyromancy.
So, the day I became Undead, I was ecstatic.
I felt as if I'd been chosen to attune myself to the ancient arts.
… Of course, it wasn't all that romantic in the end…

(Before killing Artorias)
Did you happen across Knight Artorias?
The legendary Abysswalker, from the old tales.
…Well, if you haven't, it's just as well…
He's a colourless sort, if you ask me.
Mwah hah hah!
So, what did that giant mushroom make you do?
Not that I care. It's none of my business.
Heh heh heh…
Hm? I've little to talk about, really.

(After killing Artorias)
Did you really slay Knight Artorias?
I've heard the Abyss found him first, but even still…
That's absolutely treacherous.
Yes, magnificently so!
Mwah hah hah!
Believe it or not…
Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself.
Fooled by that toothy serpent, they upturned the grave of primeval man, and incited his ornery wrath.
What could they have been thinking?
But to you and I, it's all ancient history.
You have to ask yourself. Does it really matter?
Heh heh heh…

What? If you've something to say, then say it!

My companions are M'lady and her young knights.
She is young, but burdened by an Undead mission.
We are her defenses, to keep her from harm.
An Undead mission?
Regrettably, I cannot share that with you.
But you are my pupil, perhaps if you show your faith…
Answer ""yes""
Very well. I can surely tell you, of all people…
Undead clerics are given a mission to seek Kindling.
Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires with humanity.
Through Kindling, we shall one day be granted magnificent powers.
Answer ""no"" (or ""yes"" but can't afford to pay)
I am afraid that may be difficult. For our missions are sacred.

Always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose yourself.

… Hmmm…
I have a favour to ask…
My mother, the Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords…
Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame.
..She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she failed to control it.
The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters, and molded them into deformed creatures.
Only I escaped, and now I am here.
But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since.
I beseech you. Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of Chaos.
I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery…
…But you…
I realize what I am asking. But please, free their pour souls…
Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt, but surely a thousand years of atonement is enough!

Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks?
Who are you so uncouth as to lack such judgment?
By the looks of you… I should think not.

You're no Hollow, are you?
Thank goodness.
Please be careful. There are two fierce Hollows not far from here.
They were once brave knights… my former escorts.
Who would let such strong spirits be Hollowed so?
Heavens… Is there nothing… Nothing at all to be done?

You banished those two Hollows, did you?

I am certain that both Vince and Nico are grateful to you.
Thank you so very much.

Hello… I will never forget what you did.
I am deeply indebted,
for it was not within my power to save Vince or Nico.
I cannot thank you enough.
In case you have not heard, I am Rhea of Thorolund.
I only wish there were some way I could help you,
but I am inexperienced, and I only know the art of Miracles.
If that could be of any help, speak to me again.
Would a Miracle be of any help to you?
I would be most pleased if that were so.
May we discuss Miracles, then?

(this part is nonexistant if you kill Patches before Rhea goes to the catacombs)
Vince and Nico were fooled by a lout named Patches, and turned into Hollows.
My prayers did them no good.
It is my ignorance, my frailty that has sealed their fates.
Perhaps Petrus realized my weakness all along,
and thus made the decision to abandon me.
I can hardly blame him now.
(If Petrus is killed)
I do not warm easily to unfamiliar faces.
The bonfire below is so very frequented, it makes it difficult…
I have lost all those who were close to me.

First time speaking to him
Hrm?
Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head.
And more importantly, you're free. How on earth…
…Well, I shouldn't pry.
I am Rickert of Vinheim.
I was once an established smith, but look at me now.
Can you believe it?
Hm? What is it?
Have you…Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape.
It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out there.
Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.
How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools.
I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!

We're both cursed; Undead. But what's there, really, to moan about?
Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him.

He was a royal member of Dragon School, until he turned Undead.
I hear he was quite the character… Only, that was a hundred years ago.
What interest have you in the old eccentric now?
Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works.
We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in.
That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least.
We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars.

Let's teach you the clan basic now,

Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey. That's the way we do it.
Only… Don't forget what Alvina said. Traitors aren't given a second chance, for any reason.

Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you.

It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you.
I am Sieglinde of Catarina.
I don't know how I ended up in that crystal…
It wasn't terrible in there, but I could hardly move.
I must think of some way to repay you.

Well, hello again!
I have finally located my father.
All of your help was invaluable to us… Thank you so much.
I was finally able to pass on my mother's last words.
* My father? He went on his final adventure.
Don't worry, that's just the way he is. Undead or no. Sort of reasuring, really.
If he goes Hollow, I'll just have to kill him again.

Thank you, a saint you are.
This knight of Catarina expresses his deepest gratitude. I shall not forget this.
Please, take this; a symbol of my appreciation.
Well, our fates do seem entwined, don't they?
Perhaps this, too, is the will of Lord Gwyn!
Hah hah hah hah!
No
Yes, I see!
No need to worry!
I'll be fine. I can make it without that silly moss.
Think about it. Have I ever let a little hardship slow me down?

You need not be ashamed. We are in the same boat.

SOLAIRE OF ASTORA,http://darksouls.wikidot.com/solaire-of-astora,"Undead Burg
Undead Burg
First time speaking to him
Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it!
I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight.
Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun!
… Do you find that strange? Well, you should!
No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time!
Hah hah hah!
Oh, ah hah! So, I didn't scare you?
I have a proposition, if you have a moment.
Answer ""Yes""
The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined.
In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance?
So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey?
Answer ""Yes""
This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this.
We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land.
The flow of time itself is convoluted, with heroes centuries old phasing in and out.
The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure.
There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact.
But, use this,
to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds,
and engage in jolly co-operation!
Of course, we are not the only ones engaged in this.
But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by its brilliant aura.
If you miss it, you must be blind!
Hah hah hah!
Answer ""No""
Well, yes, quite understandable.
Not to worry. I do not wish to impose.
I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we?
Hah hah hah!
Answer ""No""
Well, yes, quite understandable.
Not to worry. I do not wish to impose.
I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we?
Hah hah hah!
Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun.
The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!
If only I could be so grossly incandescent!

Hmm! Ah, oh…hello there.
Forgive me, I was just pondering…about my poor fortune.
I did not find my own sun, not in Anor Londo, nor in Twilight Blighttown.
Where else might my sun be? Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the Gravelord… ?
But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this!
But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me…
What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without reason?
Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off!
Hah hah hah!

I did not find my own sun, not in Anor Londo, nor in Twilight Blighttown.
Where else might my sun be? Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the Gravelord… ?
But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this!
But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me…
What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without reason?
Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off!
Hah hah hah!
Speak to him at the shrine (no covenant needed)
Lost Izalith

Speak to him at the bonfire
…Why?…Why?…
After all this searching, I still cannot find it…

Oh, my dear sun…What now, what should I do…?

This is a wonderful place, don't you think?
We have water, moss, moisture, these nice iron bars…
I like it here, I really do.
Nothing good ever happened to me in life.
But now that I'm Undead. I've never been happier!
Tell me honestly…
You think I've gone to the other side, don't you?
That I've cracked my head and gone Hollow…
You do, don't you?
I can see it in your eyes.
You'd trust a patch of moss over me…
Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Burg.
Only umkempt crooks and liars to be found there.

If the player has killed the Gaping Dragon
I've told you, I have nothing to discuss…
If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.

You look awfully raggedy…

We accompany M'lady on her righteous mission.
It is quite a chore, but I'm stuck with her, and Nico, too.
I can't very well abandon them now.

Oh, you yet again. You're a persistent one, aren't you? Hah hah hah.
